I got a used i5 8400 (which is plenty for my usecase, and it has a GPU integrated for hardware transcoding) pretty cheap and a Gigabyte C246-WU4 as an Amazon Warehouse deal. The i5 was so cheap that i'm currently fine without ECC memory (i only host unimportant stuff for myself), but with the C246 Board i have the option to switch to Xeon and ECC when they become cheap. And it has 10 SATA ports :D\n\nThat is, btw. one of the reasons that speaks for Ryzen (they all don't have official support / validation to run ECC, but it is also not disabled). But be warned, it is actually hard to verify if ECC is actually working or the system is just telling you it uses ECC. For that you need EPIC or Xeon.",
